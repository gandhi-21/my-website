    "I grew up and went to high school in New Delhi, India. I was part of the third graduating class from my school. After school, I moved to the US for college at the age of 17.",
    "Growing up, I have had a lot of nicknames. I won’t get into them all but my favorite so far has been Goga (think Boba but with a 'G' instead of 'B’). I was once in a newspaper for winning a BeyBlade Competition at the age of 10 and it has pretty much been one of my peak times so far.",
    "I’m a football (Soccer) Junkie and Blaugrana blood (F.C. Barcelona) runs through my veins and I’m always ready to convince someone that Lionel Messi is the Greatest Player to ever grace the sport.",
    "My Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI) is INFP and I strive for Constant Improvement. A few people I like with same personality type are J.R.R. Tolkien, Frodo Baggins and Kermit."
